# Roadmap for Pulpit: Activities for Next Versions
## [0.21]
- Community evolution visualization: when `--compare` is used, enhance `network_compare_table.html` with a Sankey diagram showing how channels moved between communities across the two exports. Which channels left community A and joined community B? Implemented in JS using the D3.js Sankey module.
- regency weights should be centered on a period of time, and there must regency weights even for the future

## [1.0]
Organization attribution of a channel can change overtime, so it can happens that a channel is in-target only for a period of time.
Basically any organization attribution pass through a model that defines a start and an end, both optional.
Only in that period of time messages are crawled, relationships are measured and so on.

- Have a deep inspection of HTML code, make sure the app and the HTML output of analysis are respecting accessibility rules and can provide a decent experience for people using screen readers
- Have a deep inspection of all options accepted by commands, verify their coherence, look for inconsistencies and bad practices
- I need strong layout coherence through all the software, inspect webapp templates and HTML outputs
