# Changelog

## [0.6] - To be announced
### New features
- New chart on the homepage and channel detail pages: **Average involvement per month** — shows the average views per message for each month, with 0 for months with no messages.

## [0.5] - 2026-03-18
### New features
- Before applying ForceAtlas2 for spatial layout, Kamada-Kawai is now used to seed initial node positions, improving layout reproducibility across runs.
- New option for `NETWORK_MEASURES`: `KATZ` (Katz centrality).
- New option for `NETWORK_MEASURES`: `BRIDGING` (bridging centrality: betweenness × neighbour-community Shannon entropy). Accepts an optional community strategy parameter: `BRIDGING(LOUVAIN)`, `BRIDGING(LEIDEN)`, etc.
- New option for `NETWORK_MEASURES`: `ALL` (expands to all available measures).
- New option for `COMMUNITY_STRATEGIES`: `ALL` (runs all available detection algorithms simultaneously).
- New `--seo` flag for `export_network`: makes the output mini-site search-engine friendly (sets `index, follow` robots tags, writes a permissive `robots.txt`). Without the flag, the output actively discourages indexing. Meta descriptions are always written regardless of this flag.
- `get_channels` now accepts `--refresh-messages-stats` to update view counts, forward counts, and pinned status on already-crawled messages. Accepts an integer (refresh the N most recent messages per channel) or a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (refresh all messages from that date to the present). Omitting a value refreshes all messages.
- Graph mini-site: social sharing section added to the About dialog, with a copyable URL and direct share buttons for major platforms.
- Webapp channel detail page: collapsible, lazily loaded charts for message history, views, forwards sent, and forwards received per month; summary cards showing message count, total views, date range, forwards sent, and forwards received.
- Webapp stats page: summary cards for total channels, messages collected, total subscribers, date range, and total forwards; additional charts for forwards per month, views per month, and cumulative subscribers.
- Channel media type (photo, video, audio, document) is now recorded during crawling regardless of whether file download is enabled; undownloaded attachments are shown as placeholder frames in the channel detail view.

### Improvements
- `COMMUNITIES_STRATEGY` renamed `COMMUNITY_STRATEGIES` for grammatical consistency.
- Channel metadata (subscriber count, about text, location) is now persisted immediately when fetched, rather than only at the end of the crawl; location is refreshed on every run.
- `is_lost` flag is cleared automatically when a previously unreachable channel is successfully crawled again.
- Webapp interface redesigned with a clean light theme, Inter font, semantic HTML, and refined card and sidebar components.
- Graph mini-site About dialog now links to `ANALYSIS.md` on GitHub for measure and strategy documentation, replacing inline explanatory text.


## [0.4] - 2026-03-15
### New features
- Project name changed from `TNExp` to `Pulpit`.
- New option for `COMMUNITIES_STRATEGY`: `LEIDEN`.
- New option for `NETWORK_MEASURES`: `OUTDEGCENTRALITY`.
- New option for `NETWORK_MEASURES`: `HARMONICCENTRALITY`.
- `CHANNEL_TYPES` option allows to define which kind of channels you want to explore.
- `search_channels` command now accepts `--amount` option to limit how many search terms are processed per run.
- `export_network` command now accepts `--startdate` and  `--enddate` options to operate on limited time windows.
- `export_network` command now produces tabular output alongside the graph mini-site.

### Improvements
- Improved resilience against internet connection fails during crawling.
- Expanded documentation.
- Graph mini-site has a simpler file structure.
- Graph mini-site upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3, JQuery 4.0 and Sigma 3.0
- Graph mini-site moved from Font Awesome to Bootstrap Icons.
- Graph mini-site using CDNs instead of local libraries.


## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-08
### Fixed
- `KCORE` communities are now following their natural order, starting from the innermost core.


## [0.3] - 2026-03-08
### New features
- Multiple community strategies can be applied simultaneously via `COMMUNITIES_STRATEGY`.
- HITS Hub, HITS Authority, Betweenness Centrality, and In-degree Centrality network measures added to graph export and node detail panel.
- `NETWORK_MEASURES` option controls which measures are calculated and exported. Default is `PAGERANK`.
- About dialog in the graph mini-site: shows a description of Pulpit, a link to the GitHub repository, graph statistics, and explanatory text for all computed measures and active community strategies.
- Labels visibility option in the graph Options panel: Always, On size (default), or Never.
- Clicking a channel name in the connections list (inbound, outbound, or mutual) navigates to that channel's detail and highlights its network.

### Improvements
- Channels that resolve to user accounts are now flagged and skipped during crawling and graph export.
- Channel `about` field is now included in admin search.
- Isolated nodes are grouped into a single community in Louvain and Infomap strategies.
- `KCORE` community strategy now produces finer-grained results using k-shell decomposition.
- The local web server no longer breaks when `export_network` is re-run.
- `export_network` produces a leaner graph mini-site with unused assets removed.
- `export_network` now prints step-by-step progress so you can follow what is happening.
- Graph mini-site upgraded to Bootstrap 5.
- Node detail panel shows only the measures that were actually computed for the current export.

### Backward incompatibility
- IE is no longer supported in graph mini-site.


## [0.2] - 2026-03-03
### New features
- Stats page showing month-by-month global channel activity.
- `get_channels` gained a `--fixholes` option to detect and fill gaps in message history.

### Improvements
- `get_channels` output is more detailed and informative.
- `get_channels` now resolves previously unresolved channel references.
- Profile pictures are downloaded only once.
- `FloodWaitError` handling in the crawler is more robust.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-02
### Fixed
- Direct channel references in messages are now correctly processed.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
